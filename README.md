# Spotify-Data-Analysis
Analyzing the most important features affecting the popularity of a song. Finding out what music factors make a good/popular song.

In this repository I'm using Pandas library to show the flexibility of of this tool in data analysis. For visualization of the data I use sns and matplotlib.plt. 
The project was created out of passion for music and coding. Enjoy!

The dataset I used comes from: https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks
You'll find there a few csv files, each comprising of different type of very detailed data.

The matrix below shows the factors measured by spotify and their correlation with popularity of a track.
